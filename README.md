#### Introduction

Saiv is a highly flexible and feature-packed toolkit manager developed to make organizing, executing, and deploying scripts and tools easy in dynamic environments. For developers, system administrators, or enthusiasts managing several projects, Saiv brings in an amicable interface and enormous functionality for a more productive workflow.

#### Key Features

1. **Toolkit Management**

**Create a Toolkit**
- Begin by creating a new toolkit within which to develop a custom toolkit for your project. Saiv allows the definition of tools, their names, directories, and entry pointsâ€”ensuring that all these parts are well integrated.

**Load and Manage Toolkits**
- Access existing toolkits easily. Saiv allows you to load and manage many saved XML files. Each of them can easily be configured, modified, or even further extended by new tools as necessary for your project.

2. **Tool Operations**

**Add and Remove Tools**
- Add new tools to your toolkit using the command line interface. Inform it of a tool's name, directory path, and entry point command to be able to add more abilities on an ad-hoc basis.
- Easily eliminates outdated or unwanted tools and hence keeps the structure of the toolkit clean and efficient.

**Executing Tools**
- Start any tool from the toolkit with simple, intuitive commands. Saiv can execute tools using launch arguments that are customizable, meaning that the execution of the tool could easily be suited for the needs of each project.

3. **Toolkit Construction**

**Building Toolkits**
- Build new toolkits on GHPM connection files or addresses. With Saiv, there is an easy way of adding a group of external scripts and resources inside one toolkit, allowing flexibility for any project.

4. **Export and Deployment**

**Export Toolkits**
- Export your current toolkit to be implemented across various environments. Saiv is intelligent enough to adjust file paths and entry points, ensuring that the integration and functionality will be available upon deployment.

**Copying Directories**
- Copy directories within toolkits easily. This is an excellent feature for maintaining project structure integrity or packaging up for deployment without breaking working configurations.
